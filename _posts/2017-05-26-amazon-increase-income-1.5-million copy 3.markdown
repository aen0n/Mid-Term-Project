**What do Pokémon, the Belgian Grand Prix, American Express, the French Unemployment Agency, Duvel Brewery, and the Boat maker MarineMax have in common?**

They were all compromised by cyber crime in March, 2024.  We've compiled a list of the biggest known cyber attacks, data breaches and ransomware attacks in the month gone by. 

1. Ransomware Attacks in March 2024
2. Cyber Attacks in March 2024
3. Data Breaches in March 2024
4. New Malware and Ransomware Discovered
5. Vulnerabilities Discovered and Patches Released 
6. Advisories issued, reports, analysis etc. in March 2024

Cyber Crime is at an all-time high. The third month of 2024 was no different. A cyber attack or ransomware attack has made news almost every day. Victims have included organisations from every industry type including gaming, healthcare, water utility services, breweries and more. 

The idea behind compiling the below lists is not just to highlight the rampant rise in cyber crime but also empower organisations globally with knowledge to equip themselves against cybersecurity incidents. A historical perspective on recent attacks, attack methodologies and how organisations responded can empower you with key insights on improving your own organisational cyber resilience.  

This knowledge can help you take a critical look at your own Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan and review and refresh it as per your organisational threat context. Also take the alarming prevalence of cyber crime as a clarion call to test the effectiveness of your cybersecurity plans and processes with regular scenario-based Cyber Crisis Tabletop Exercises. 

These exercises help you rehearse your organisational response to cyber attacks and data breaches in a simulated attack environment. They help your staff become more conversant with your incident response plans and playbooks. In addition, they build muscle-memory and aid in decision-making practice for actual cyber events. 

Enhancing cyber resilience is an ongoing process that requires constant attention and collective effort to stay ahead of cybersecurity threats. It's important to remember, however, that achieving true cybersecurity resilience is indeed possible with the correct strategy and resources. The ultimate goal is not to prevent cyber crime altogether as that simply isn't possible. But to create enough resources that help you bounce back and resume operations after a cybersecurity incident with minimal impact. 

> New Ransomware/Malware Discovered in March 2024

*1. CryptoChameleon*
A new phishing kit named CryptoChameleon is being used to target Federal Communications Commission (FCC) employees, using specially crafted single sign-on (SSO) pages for Okta that appear remarkably similar to the originals.
