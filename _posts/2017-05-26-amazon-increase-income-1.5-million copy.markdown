**James Marsden comments on the possibility of returning as Scott Summers aka Cyclops in the 2024 MCU movie Deadpool & Wolverine, saying, "It'd be fun."**

James Marsden has responded to speculation about his potential return as Cyclops in the upcoming MCU movie Deadpool & Wolverine. Marsden previously played Scott Summers aka Cyclops in Fox's X-Men movie franchise. Marsden last appeared briefly in X-Men: Days of Future Past, and there hasn't been any official announcement about his return to the role. However, his proximity to the Deadpool & Wolverine set has led to speculation that Marsden will be one of the film's many cameos.

Marsden recently appeared alongside former Batman Michael Keaton on The Playlist. During the discussion, Marsden was asked about him potentially appearing in Deadpool & Wolverine as he had been spotted near the film's sets. Marsden said he was nearby finishing up work on the upcoming Sonic 3 movie, but seemed reluctant to discuss Deadpool 3 in detail. Marsden's comments can be seen below:

> "I keep hearing about that. I can’t walk down the street without someone asking me so evidently there’s a lot of chatter about that. It’d be fun. [...] We just wrapped [Sonic 3] actually. We were near the Deadpool stages up there in Pinewood actually. [...] Yeah, this is a little bit of a Pandora's box ."

Marsden calling the topic of Deadpool & Wolverine a "Pandora's box" and his reluctance to give a definitive answer might suggest that he will be returning. After all, Marvel likes their stars to stay tight-lipped about spoilers.

The last time Marsden appeared as Cyclops was in X-Men: Days of Future Past following Wolverine resetting the timeline and bringing him back to life. After that, Fox pivoted to focusing on a younger X-Men team, where the role was taken up by Tye Sheridan. The events of Fox's more recent X-Men timeline would have suggested that Marsden's version of the character no longer existed, but that's never been a big issue for the Fox franchise.

Fox's X-Men timelines are pretty messy, something Deadpool even made a joke about. Marsden's return as Cyclops could pay off this joke, with a reference to Deadpool being unsure which version of the character was going to show up. Alternatively, Marvel could just rely on audiences not having kept track of Fox's multiple timelines, and just remembering Marsden in the role because the original X-Men movies were well-received. Either way, Deadpool & Wolverine could easily include Marsden's Cyclops without raising too many questions as to how or why he is there.
