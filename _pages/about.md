I'm Park Haewon, a software major student at Dankook University. I'm currently in my fourth year, and I'm developing Unreal Engine Game as a Capstone project as part of my graduation project. I'm also interested in developing financial apps and security, and I'm currently working on research on areas of interest.

The world is big and wide, and there are so many different people. Among those countless people, I'm not sure that I'm remarkably good at developing, nor that I'm sure that I'm developing at a rapid pace. At the same time, I don't believe that the two things mentioned above determine a person's ability. 

My goals are clear. Strong beliefs have given me leadership and passion to carry out projects, and long social experience has taught me how to deal with human relationships. I'll leave it up to deciding which is more valuable, the ability to handle AI or the ability to communicate well with people.
